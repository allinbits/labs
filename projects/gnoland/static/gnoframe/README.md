# GnoFrame

## "Don’t just share links — share logic, meaning, and ownership.”

# What is it?

GnoFrame is a framework designed for the Gno.land ecosystem that provides utilities for rendering and managing content, metadata, and sharing features in a decentralized environment.

## Key aspects of GnoFrame:

- **Metadata Management**: Implements sharing feature best practices, including structured metadata, image recommendations, and mobile-friendly links.
- **Gno Lang Rendering**: Uses the Render function in gno code for dynamic, path-based content rendering.
- **Web Integration**: Contains a Frame structure in markdown for embedding GnoFrame content in web pages, including styles, scripts, and JSON data.
- **Decentralization**: Focuses on decentralized linking and metadata in alignment with Gno.land's principles.
